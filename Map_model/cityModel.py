def traverse(current, end_location):
    """
    :param current: Current location within road network
    :param end_location: Desired location to end travel at
    :Output: Doesn't return anything at the moment, prints a lot for understanding how objects are being traversed in
    the road network. Once the code is finalized, unneeded printing can be commented out.

    Currently, every road and highway object has an attribute called connections which is an ordered list of all the
    connected objects. The objects are ordered as they occur in the diagram of the road network:
    road1.connections ----> [endpoint3, inter2, inter1, onRamp1]

    The code uses the roads and highways to find the connections of objects, finds the next and previous index, and
    appends them to a list choices IF they are not a recent location unless they are and endpoint, at which point to
    leave the previous location must be traveled. The objects in the list will be randomly picked from, as no route
    algorithm exists yet.

        Issues:
    1. Traverse function could have a new function made from the existing code used for generating the travel
    choices for connected roads at a location.
    2. Illegal movements are made right now. Traveling from Road objects to offRamp Ramp objects isn't allowed.
    Traveling from an onRamp to another offRamp immediately across a highway shouldn't be possible, this would
    require adding attributes to highway like lanes.
    3. Fixing the illegal ramp movements would also require changing the choice generation code in traverse, because
    not all Ramp objects are the end of a road (e.g. offRamp3, onRamp2) and so if they are not a legal move and
    shouldn't be traveled to, instead of NOT appending them, the code should loop back and decrement or increment
    to whichever index in the next direction, should it exist, to find something else to travel to. Otherwise, you can
    not pass beyond that point.
    4. The parent road used to calculate the speed to travel between locations doesn't seem to always match the
    road that is actually being traveled. I don't know if this is true, but I have feeling. Need testing.
