        :Output: Doesn't return anything at the moment, prints a lot for understanding how objects are being traversed in
        the road network. Once the code is finalized, unneeded printing can be commented out.

        Currently, every road and highway object has an attribute called connections which is an ordered list of all the
        connected objects. The objects are ordered as they occur in the diagram of the road network:
        road1.connections ----> [endpoint3, inter2, inter1, onRamp1]

        The code uses the roads and highways to find the connections of objects, finds the next and previous index, and
        appends them to a list choices IF they are not a recent location unless they are and endpoint, at which point to
        leave the previous location must be traveled. The objects in the list will be randomly picked from, as no route
        algorithm exists yet.

            Issues:
        1. Traverse function could have a new function made from the existing code used for generating the travel
        choices for connected roads at a location.
        2. Illegal movements are made right now. Traveling from Road objects to offRamp Ramp objects isn't allowed.
        Traveling from an onRamp to another offRamp immediately across a highway shouldn't be possible, this would
        require adding attributes to highway like lanes.
        3. Fixing the illegal ramp movements would also require changing the choice generation code in traverse, because
        not all Ramp objects are the end of a road (e.g. offRamp3, onRamp2) and so if they are not a legal move and
        shouldn't be traveled to, instead of NOT appending them, the code should loop back and decrement or increment
        to whichever index in the next direction, should it exist, to find something else to travel to. Otherwise, you can
        not pass beyond that point.
        4. The parent road used to calculate the speed to travel between locations doesn't seem to always match the
        road that is actually being traveled. I don't know if this is true, but I have feeling. Need testing.
